# QJSONWrapper
A simple wrapper class for JSON file reading and writing operations in Qt.
I wrote this simple class wrapper class just so that any one can quickly read/write a JSON file in Qt.

Please note this is not an implementation of JSON parser so it won't wwork for anything below Qt5.

I hope you find this wrapper useful. Feel free to modify as per your requirements.
